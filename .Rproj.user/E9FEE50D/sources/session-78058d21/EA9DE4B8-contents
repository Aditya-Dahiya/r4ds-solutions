## Solutions

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
```

## 3.5 Exercises

1. Why does this code not work?

Because in "my_variable" theres a 1 instead of an i in variable

2. Tweak each of the R commands so they run properly

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

3. Press Alt + Shift + K. What happens? How can you get to the same place using the menus?

Pulls up keyboard shortcuts

4. Let's revisit an exercise from the [SectionÂ 2.6](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-visualize.html#sec-ggsave). Run the following lines of code. Which of the two plots is saved as `mpg-plot.png`? Why?

the "my_bar_plot" is saved because thats what was specified

```{r}
my_bar_plot <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class)) +
  geom_bar()
my_scatter_plot <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()
ggsave(filename = "mpg-plot.png", plot = my_bar_plot)
```
